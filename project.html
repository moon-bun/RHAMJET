        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:10px">
          Our project, RhamScan, is one that will revolve around being a mobile application, and by extension, a computer application. The app will delve into the art world, revolving around drawings and paintings and the Melbourne graffiti art scene. <br>
          <br>
          The primary feature of this app is an Alternate Reality (AR) function, where a user can use their mobile device to scan, upload, or take pictures of paintings or drawings, where the application will analyse and infer information about it. The user can also generate QR codes from these works to print out and place in the real-world environment, where other users can scan these to view and interact with the art in AR, akin to an art gallery but in a digital form. This process is gamified to encourage participation. <br>
          <br>
          There may also be a feature that allows users to interact with the environment by scanning any flat surface, such as wall, to draw and use as a digital canvas, immortalizing that piece of art in RhamScan’s AR Melbourne for other users to find and appreciate.<br>
          <br>
          For any piece of artwork submitted to RhamScan’s AR Melbourne, it will be uploaded to an image hosting platform associated with the application, where users can view art and interact with other users. </p>
      </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        RHAMJET is motivated by a love for art and a desire to get more people invested in art as a hobby. With our app, RHAMJET aims to spread art in Melbourne and inspire Melbournians (and visitors) to create and collaborate on a city-wide gallery. RhamScan will achieve this by making art fun and accessible, superimposing an open-source gallery onto reality.<br>
        <br>
        Melbourne is internationally recognised for our art culture - street art, tagging, and graffiti specifically. RhamScan will expand on our current art culture, with graffiti mechanics in AR. We are inviting Melbourne citizens to explore Melbourne, appreciate the creations of past artists, and contribute to our city themselves.<br>

        <br>

        Art is often seen as an impenetrable hobby to the average person. “I can’t draw” is too common a sentiment held by people, and RHAMJET endeavours to break down this sort of thinking by framing it as virtual graffiti. Graffiti is considered ‘low’ art, but in this instance it works to our advantage. Participating in graffiti is less intimidating than picking up a pencil and attempting a ‘real go’ at drawing, and it’s fun to leave your mark in the world (as evidenced by public school desks and public toilet doors). In reality, graffiti and illustration are both completely valid art mediums. As well as a platform for existing artists, RHAMJET hopes to introduce art as hobby to people who wouldn’t have considered it before encountering RhamScan.<br>

        <br>

        As a digital gallery, RhamScan will also serve as an immortal timeline of art and art information database. RhamScan will be a platform for all artists – be they novice, aspiring, or world-renowned – to showcase their work and connect with other artists.<br>

        <br>

        Though this is a Melbourne based project designed with Melbourne culture in mind, if RhamScan becomes popular enough, we would like to expand into other parts of the world.
      </p>

    <div class="main">
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>
      <h4>AR Functions</h4>
      <p>
        The primary focus of RhamScan will be its AR utilization. Users will use their mobile phones to take a picture or scan a piece of artwork to analyse and add to RhamScan’s database of images. It is only limited to 2D artworks, such as drawings, paintings, or prints. Other art mediums do not currently fit within the scope of the project. However, as AR capabilities grow we may consider adding additional art mediums to the project such as sculptures, music or animations in future. The drawings or paintings in RhamScan can be of the user’s own creation, or from renowned artists. From here, the app can provide useful information regarding the complexities of the artwork. <br>

        <br>

        One such aspect is displaying to the user what sort of techniques that were implemented when creating the artwork, such as art principles, techniques, brush strokes, materials used, and more. If a user visits an art gallery and scans a historical piece or from a well renowned artist, the app has the capability to also provide information such as the artist’s name, pricing, and brief history behind it. This sort of information will be gleaned from the internet, as well as its own database of saved information.<br>

        <br>

        With regards to the AR element, RhamScan will have the ability to map digital images onto the real-world environment. Users can select images in the app and be able to display these artworks onto their surroundings to view on their phone screens, much like perusing an art gallery, but in this instance, a digital art gallery in the user’s own environment.<br>

        <br>

        The app may map these images directly onto the environment, or by QR codes which are generated from artworks that were submitted and scanned which can be pasted around. Users can choose a “spot”, sticking their QR code wherever and adjust how their image will be displayed, adjusting the parameters and such. Scanning these codes will display and map the image onto whatever surface it is on, along with any supplementing information about it. Users will also have the ability to draw directly onto their surroundings, such as a wall on a building, much like a digital canvas where they will have access to a range of tools similar to an art program.<br>

        <br>

        Getting a machine to be able to identify pieces of artwork in the real world is a complex task. Being able to analyse and display information regarding the artwork adds more layers of complexity, so this will be a major hurdle for us as a team to tackle. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h4>The Game Aspect</h4>
      <p>
        One major feature that we will be implementing into RhamScan, is a game aspect. One of the major outcomes of this project is to help inspire and grow the art culture in Melbourne, so what better way than to gamify the whole project. The way we will go about this is by taking inspiration from games such as the likes of Pokémon Go or Geocaching.  The primary draw of these games was the incentivisation for players to go out into the world and explore, discovering hidden marvels of the world, and to add to their stash of collectibles. Now although the hype for Pokémon Go has long since died out, we believe that taking inspiration and following in similar footsteps to apply to our own app will ultimately allow us to achieve our project outcomes. <br>

        <br>

        In order to get Melburnians out there in the wild to see and experience the art in the streets, players are tasked to go out and locate QR codes hidden by other players. Searching for these, players will attempt to locate these codes in order to scan with the app and be able to view the image in the AR dimension. These QR codes will have a distinct design and branding to distinguish it from others. For each artwork scanned, points will be awarded to the player’s account. The player’s total score may be completely arbitrary and just for show, or it may come with other benefits such as in-game benefits like access to premium features or customization options. After scanning and receiving points, the player may interact with the image, being able to give it an upvote or leaving a comment. To encourage creativity and ingenuity, more points are awarded from more exceptionally obscure artworks, or niche ones where not as many people have discovered it. This can be determined by the interaction level, being its upvote score and player activity. These scanned artworks can be added to the player’s digital gallery, acting as a sort of collection.
        <br>
        <br>



        It is imagined that it would be quite difficult to locate such a small square paper in such a large and expansive city. A map system will be implemented to mitigate this issue.  Using the phone’s GPS, the app will draw out a map of the city showing all the landmarks, major and minor streets, as well as the player’s position and orientation. Rest stops and safe areas, such as public places should be marked, just as a precaution for the player’s safety. Displayed on the map will be the general locations of artworks to be found, this can be represented as a circle on the map or coloured in areas. However, the specifications on where the codes can be found should not be overly explicit, otherwise that would lead to too easy of a find and an unsatisfactory experience.<br>

        <br>

        Before other players can go out and prospect for artwork, creators would be required to post and register their codes to the app. Players are encouraged to print out copies of their chosen artworks QR codes to then deposit them in all sorts of locations all around Melbourne. After gluing or taping the code to a wall or something similar, creators will need to register their QR codes onto the app for them to be logged into the database as ‘active’ art for other players to eventually find. After completing these steps, creators are then allowed to set parameters and details for their artwork. Adjusting the size, ensuring there aren’t any errors in the image mapping onto the object, these are steps that should be taken before submitting the artwork into the app. Completing this will update the database and map with an instance of the artwork, becoming available to be scanned.  The artist may provide a description for their hidden artwork on the map marker, possibly containing hints, or adjusting the scale of the searchable area, whether they wish to narrow it down or widen the area to scale the difficulty up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h4>Image Hosting and Further Gamified Mechanics</h4>
      <p>RhamScan will include its own online image hosting website, similar to DeviantArt, Instagram, Tumblr... etc.  but exclusive to the RhamScan works hidden and discoverable inside our AR Melbourne. This will be a database of art, utilizing servers and cloud storage to store our data. <br>

        <br>

      Users will be able to set up profiles with their artist information and a ‘Personal Gallery’ of their own works. Users will also have a ‘Collector’s Gallery,’ consisting of works created by other artists that the user has discovered and scanned throughout Melbourne. As Personal and Collectors Galleries may become quite large over time, there will be options to sort artwork in each gallery into labelled subsections. <br>

       <br>

      Profiles will have Artist Levels and a score associated with the amount of upvotes the works in their Personal Gallery garner. This is a function meant to limit attempts to cheat the system and farm points with low effort uploads. We will endeavour to encourage users to upvote art based on effort and an earnest attempt at community contribution. Collector’s Galleries will also have Collector Levels and a score associated with how many works a user has discovered to encourage art hunting. A public weekly/monthly/yearly Artist and Collector leader board will be prominently displayed to encourage users to participate, create, and hunt for art. In future we may begin incorporating events like July’s ‘Art Fight’ to encourage participation, and further gamify the experience. <br>

       <br>

      From the website the user can upload works, and enter art information about these works such as a general description, materials used, medium... etc. though an art piece will not enter a user’s personal gallery unless it has been marked as their own work. Each work an artist uploads will generate a QR code. As previously stated, RhamScan QR codes will have recognisable branded border art to mark it as an RhamScan art piece, but minor options for users to personalise their personal QR code borders will be available. The artist can then hide the QR code somewhere in Melbourne and register the location in RhamScan. Alternatively, the artist has the previously mentioned option of superimposing the uploaded painting onto a flat surface at any physical location they can reach in Melbourne, using their phone camera and the mobile app GPS location tracking system. There will be a limit imposed on how much art a user can upload daily to prevent users from cheating the system using multiple accounts to farm points. Upload Limit is a potential premium feature for high scoring collectors.
      <br>
      <br>


      The website will be accessible through desktop as well as the RhamScan mobile app. Users will be able to view all works registered in RhamScan’s online gallery, excepting paintings creators have hidden and marked ‘only unlocked through exploration.’ Those works will only be viewable through physically hunting for the QR code/painting in AR Melbourne and scanning it into a user's Collector’s Gallery (with optional hints provided by the creators). Hidden artwork is worth considerably more Collector points. All unhidden artworks will be searchable and viewable in the database. Users will be able to sort through and filter for different types and genres of the unhidden art they’d like to view and appreciate. However, it is only possible to gain Collector points through finding the piece in Melbourne and scanning it into your Collector’s Gallery. Considering this, creators of an art piece can provide hints or ‘maps’ accessed through the website. Publicising the location of a work to encourage collectors to travel Melbourne and add it to their Collectors Gallery.

       <br>
       <br>

      Users will be able to interact with other users. They will be able to upvote, comment and/or provide feedback, and view information about individual art pieces. Comments will also be upvote-able, and the site will encourage users to upvote comments that are particularly insightful and/or constructive to the artistic process. Comment upvotes will contribute to Collector’s Level scores. This is done to encourage engagement and growth in the community. There will also be chatting, forum, and private messaging features included on the website to foster artist collaboration and engagement.  </p>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Tools & Technology</h2>
      <p><strong>QR Codes</strong><br>
        Scannable arrays of black and white squares that act as barcodes. They can be read by digital devices, including phones, to reveal information or link to URLs. RhamScan will use QR code technology to store artwork.
      </p>
      <p><strong>App Development Programs for Mobile App Development</strong><br>
        Dependent on if RhamScan is being developed for Apple and/or Android OS. For Apple, Xcode and iOS SDK is necessary. For Android, Android Studio IDE and Android SDK is necessary.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Programming Languages</strong><br>
        Python, SQL, HTML and CSS at minimum is necessary to create RhamScan. Java and XML is necessary if RhamScan branches into android app development, while Swift is necessary for iOS.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Servers to Host Data, Cloud Computing </strong><br>
        With the implementation of QR Codes as the method of projecting artwork into the real-world as a core function of the project, there would need to be server hosting our database that would hold the necessary information such as the artwork itself and the associated information about it such as the artist’s name, description and other optional tags that can be placed upon it. This can be accomplished by using a cloud database, however proprietary software like AzureSQL and Google Cloud SQL cost money and as such will not be added in the prototyping stage of the software for the sake of this assessment. <br>
        <br>

        The QR Code would work in conjunction with the server, as it would use the information stored on the QR Code to identify which artwork to display and send a database query to return the necessary information to project it in the app through the internet to the database server. The app would then be responsible for using the information stored on the QR Code and the database to assemble the augmented reality for the user.
      </p>
      <p><strong>AR Technology Needed </strong><br>
        In order to incorporate features such as scanning QR codes, AR art gallery, AR art search and even drawing, a piece of open-source software is required as it will be used to scan, process the image and output a set result. A range of modern devices need to be supported. An example of this software can be Google’s ARCore as is it free to use and supports a wide range of Android and iOS devices. ARCore allows it to be integrated to Android Studio which is useful for us to begin development.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br>
        Cybersecurity measured must be implemented to protect user data and art. Most pertinent measures include password and data encryption and multifactor authentication for user accounts.
      </p>
      <p><strong>GPS & Location Tracking</strong><br>
        RhamScan will need precise location tracking for all of Melbourne to accurately ‘set’ AR artwork locations. This can be done using Google Maps API. This location tracking must be implemented in way that does not drain battery considerably.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Computer</strong><br>
        Necessary for programming, and testing of RhamScan’s associated image hosting website.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mobile Devices</strong><br>
        Necessary for testing all RhamScan functions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p><strong>Machine Learning and Computer Vision</strong><br>
        The skills necessary to create image recognition AI in python is necessary for RhamScan. Our program needs to be able to scan an image, recognise art, isolate art from the environment, and differentiate art pieces from each other. The most difficult skill for our group to develop, as none of our members have previous experience with AI or Machine Learning.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Database Management</strong><br>
        SQL and database design knowledge is key. A robust database is necessary to organise art, artists, and their information. The database needs to be designed with flexibility and growth in mind to accommodate plans to incorporate more art mediums in future. This should not be a difficult learning curve for our team, as we are all currently taking a Database course.
      </p>
      <p><strong>UX design</strong><br>
        Front-end development skills, and knowledge of HTML and CSS. RhamScan will require a thorough understanding of design heuristics, useability, and the prototyping process. Skills in this area should not be difficult to source, as RHAMJET members are also taking a User-centred design course and some members have previous knowledge of HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Coding</strong><br>
        All the above, in addition to back-end development of the app itself, necessitates programming knowledge in a variety of languages. RhamScan at the minimum requires knowledge of Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS. Fortunately, RHAMJET does have members experienced with these languages.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="main">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>RhamScan will allow many people to explore Melbourne in different cultures. However, the main use of RhamScan is for allowing individuals to explore the art culture that Melbourne has and to inspire artists in following their passion. RhamScan will provide young artists to explore art in many ways through the digital canvas. For the Melbournians, to engage in the art culture the gaming aspect was introduced which provides an aim for the individual to achieve while also learning more about the inspiration that an artist placed into their artwork.
