    <h1>TOPIC</h1>
    <p><br>
      The team at RHAMJET, a group of 7 eccentric individuals, will be developing a mobile application called Rhamscan. This project will be an ambitious undertaking for all of us, dipping our toes into the world of app development and having to approach professional work as beginners.
<br><br>
Our project, Rhamscan, will be a mobile app that will revolve around the art scene, combining contemporary and historical art, to the digital world. To go about this, our team will be implementing an Alternate Reality (AR) function within the app. This feature will be used to harness the powers of technology, where it will allow users to scan 2D images such as drawings or paintings and map them out onto the real world where they can be viewed on mobile devices. For this to happen, we will also be developing QR code functionalities into Rhamscan, where codes will be generated from scanned artworks. These codes can be printed out and pasted all around Melbourne, whether it be on walls of buildings or graffiti-covered walls, where other users can scan and view these artworks. In essence, we will essentially be turning the world around us into a digital gallery.
<br><br>
Our app may contain a feature which will provide information on any piece of scanned artwork. Scanning a drawing or painting will provide the user with art-related information, with things that include the materials used to create the artwork, techniques used, and general tips and facts relating to whatever medium was used. Scanning famous or historical artworks will provide a synopsis of the history behind it, and any other interesting tidbits about it. However, this feature is a very ambitious task to implement, and with our strict time frame to develop and our current skill level, this is only a proposed idea that could be developed, provided we had more time.
<br><br>
To encourage user participation with scanning and posting pictures, there will be a game aspect being integrated into our app. Using the QR codes generated from scanning their artworks, users will stick these codes all around Melbourne, where people will hunt around for these to scan and earn points, much like an easter egg hunt. As of right now, it makes the most sense to centralize the scope of the project to Melbourne. This game feature will be one of the main draws of Rhamscan, however we will be prioritizing delivering the AR functionalities of the app, as this forms the basis of every feature in our app. To complement the app, we will be developing an image hosting app, which may double as a social media platform. Users can interact with others and upload their own images or other miscellaneous things to do with the app such as artworks they’ve found. </p>

    <div class="motivation">
    <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
    <p><br>
      We as a collective over at RHAMJET, are motivated by our passion for art, and a desire to invest more people into art as a hobby. In developing our app, Rhamscan, we aim to spread the art culture all throughout Melbourne and to inspire people, visitors and outsiders, to appreciate art as much as we do. Taking a walk around the city, you may find that Melbourne boasts quite the collection of art, graffiti art in particular. Using Rhamscan and its easter egg-hunt mechanics, we believe that we can tap into this sort of street art and tagging culture through the use of its AR mechanics, placing your mark digitally onto the world for other people to stumble upon and to appreciate it.
<br><br>
In addition to placing your art digitally anywhere in the environment, this would allow for aspiring artists to have access to another avenue of showcasing their own artwork. In increasing the availability of avenues for artists to showcase their works, this would encourage many young artists to fill themselves with determination and inspire them to create.
<br><br>
In this current tech environment, we are seeing many breakthroughs in what can currently be achieved by our mobile devices.  AR technology is seeing a surge in popularity recently, where people can be seen using apps for entertainment, or practical use. The mobile game market is quite booming, with almost everyone owning a mobile phone and playing games with them. If we ever attract a potential employer who would show interest in our project, we would be able to present them with many promising attributes, worthy of their investment. For one, our app will hopefully see no issue in garnering a user base in this current mobile app market, considering the current popularity of AR technology. We also have quite a large selection of potential user groups, these being artists, regular people, and mobile game enthusiasts. </p>

      AR technology is quite a ground-breaking tool, and very popular nowadays. Many other applications in the market boast similar features that Rhamscan makes use of, which we will need to compete with. One app that exists, called WallaMe, available on Android, allows users to take pictures of a wall or any location to then draw and create a message, or attach an image. This can then be discovered by other users who own the map to come and discover these messages left behind.  Pokémon Go is an obvious example, where players travel to certain locations to capture Pokémon to add to their collection. Our proposed idea for Rhamscan to provide information on scanned artworks is quite similar to how Google Lens functions. This app allows users to point their phone cameras to any sort of object that they please, where Google Lens will identify what type of object it is and provides a search query result, giving information about it. Cart Magician is the name of another competitor. This is a tool which allows people looking to create a business, to test out their AR projects using the site to see how they function in an AR environment. Part of this toolkit lets users import images or 3D models and turn them into AR content.
<br><br>
Rhamscan differs from the rest of the apps in the market, boasting many unique features which set itself apart from our competitors. Some apps let you project 3D models onto the terrain to view it on a mobile device. Our app has a similar function, however, with our QR code functionality, we can allow images, being pictures of artworks, to be a permanent fixture on the world.  As long as it isn’t removed, these codes will remain on any object and almost become a tangible object that exists both in the real and digital world.
<br><br>
Our implementation of a game aspect is also very unique to our app. Pokémon Go revolves around a similar fashion where players try to locate Pokémon scattered around different locations. We have taken inspiration from this idea and remixed it into an easter egg hunt for artworks. All of the findable artworks are user submitted, which will contain their own artworks to be displayed to anyone who finds them. This adds a very personal element to the app and allows for users to communicate and share their interests in art. Finding and scanning artworks to collect points adds a layer of competition, for the more competitively driven people. </p>
