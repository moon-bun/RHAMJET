      <p>Communication is vital and can cause project failures if there is a lack in communication, however RHAMJET manages to have good communication through the group and between each member individually.  RHAMJET communicates through various ways including messages, meetings and face to face interaction.  <br><br>

Our meetings occur three times a week at a set time that RHAMJET has agreed upon. Having discussed these times within the group ensures that the majority of our group is available at those given times. There are unforeseen circumstances that few members can attend a meeting. If this is the case, all the members that can make it to the meeting attend and the member(s) that cannot make it are asked to watch the recording or ask other team members to get an update on what occurred during the meeting.  <br><br>

RHAMJET has a team on Microsoft Teams where we include all our shared documents, messages and meetings. Two out of our three meetings are held on this online platform. These two meetings are held on Mondays at 8:30pm and Saturday 9:00pm. These meetings are recorded for team members to reference back to what had been discussed. In these two meetings, we will have a progress report where each member will have the chance to talk to the group for one to two minutes about what they have done since the previous meeting. In these meetings, discussions will also take place on problems that any team members are facing or information that needs clarifications and agreement from other team members.  <br><br>

Our third meeting designated by RHAMJET is a face-to-face meeting on Thursdays 4:30pm at RMIT University. During these meetings, we will do tasks that require all our team members and discussions that are difficult to take place on an online platform occur during this meeting.  <br><br>

Apart from our regular meetings, RHAMJET uses Microsoft Teams and Discord to message one another. On Microsoft Teams, messages of getting things done are output by different team members. For important discussions that occur outside the meeting occur on discord. RHAMJET had discussed using discord as our main messages tool as it is accessible and easy for use by each member in the group. RHAMJET uses discord to discuss small factors that need to take place and get another team memberâ€™s attention through tagging them when messaging outside our assigned meeting times or even reminding them that the meeting is about to take place soon. <br><br>

RHAMJET provides one day for another team mate to respond. If the team member has not responded via messages and they are not attending any of the meetings, the team member can ask other team members if they have any information on the team member that is not communicating with them. If none of the team members have any information about the group member, RHAMJET will alert them on online platforms, we have access to communicating with them. Finally, if we still get no response from them, RHAMJET will bring the problem up to our tutor Anthony Clapp. </p>
