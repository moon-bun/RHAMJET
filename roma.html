       <p style= "color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 14px" > My name is Roma and I come from the north side of Melbourne. I am culturally Indian however I have been born and brought up in Melbourne. I graduated high school in 2021 and I am currently studying for my bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I have experience in Python, HTML, Visual Basic and a little bit of Scratch 2. I enjoy programming and having to solve problems in the real-world and I would love to learn as many programming languages as possible therefore I am interested in software development. I also have a little bit of interest in cybersecurity. In my free time, I like to watch cricket, play netball, and spend time with my friends. I form the ‘R’ initial of team RHAMJET. </p>

       <h3 style= "color:#FFD166;" > MORE ABOUT MY HOBBIES </h3>
       <p style= "color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 14px" > One of my hobbies is watching cricket. My favourite player is Steve Smith. He is a batter in the Australian cricket team. Another hobby I have is taking photos of the natural world and landscape around me. Some of these pictures are in the images on the right. My time with my family is not special or always a happy feeling therefore I find my happiness through the memories of my friends and also spending time with them. I like to stay active therefore I used to play netball as a hobby. </p>

       <h3 style= "color:#FFD166;" > TRAVEL </h3>
       <p style= "color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 14px" > I have travelled to India and Singapore for holidays. I have been to Singapore twice with different places to visit. I have been to India many times. Both my parent's family lives in India so time to time we go visit them. I have many memories  with my family at different locations as well as different activities. Ultimately, going to India is a very enjoyable and relaxing holiday.<br><br> I love Australia in particular Melbourne the most. Obviously Melbourne has been my favourite as it Is where I have been born and brought up. I have also visited many other area in Australia including Canberra, Darwin, Perth and Gold Coast. I don’t remember much of Darwin and Perth as I was very little when I visited them however, Gold Coast provided a good warm weather with amazing activities to spend the days there. Canberra was a small trip, however a special one. In this small trip I got to visit the Australian Parliament, Memorial and many other places. Being in Melbourne, I have visited many places here and made a good memory in each visit. Currently, I am wanting to visit Sydney and Adelaide. </p>
