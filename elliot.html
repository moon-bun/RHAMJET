I graduated high school in 2020. I have a 2-year-old cat and a fishpond. In my free time, my hobbies include playing video games, drawing, and hanging out with my cat. My interest in IT mainly revolves around the more graphical aspects, such as 3D modeling. I have no experience in this field however but would like to start learning someday. I do not have any IT experience to date, however I am currently learning how to code in Python, HTML and CSS, as per the program I’m currently studying. Someday in the future, I would love to become a video game developer. I form the 'E’ initial of team RHAMJET. </p>
