        <p style="padding-left:25px">My name is Jamie and I was born and raised from the west side of Melbourne, Australia for all of my life. I have experience in three years' worth of Python, having done one major project as part of my completion of VCE Software Development, as well as experience in Visual Basic and using Arduinos as well as currently studying both SQL, HTML and CSS as part of my Information Technology course. I became interested in Information Technology by learning about coding as an activity through video games and after attempting to learn some basic code, became curious about more and more things until I got to study a Computers elective for Year 10, eventually doing VCE Software Development for Year 11 and 12. Currently I am interested in learning more about the fields of cybersecurity and both the vulnerabilities of systems in use every day and how to protect against those sorts of attacks. However, I try to keep an open mind and absorb as much knowledge as I can from every field in IT, whether it's AR/VR, robotics, big data etc. For the record, I'm the guy on the left in the image and I form the J in RHAMJET. </p>

        <p>In my spare time, I like to read and study history as a hobby as I find the lives of past humans unique and fascinating to understand. I consider myself knowledgable in the period of the French Revolution and Russian Revolution as I formally studied them for VCE, but my true fascination with history is to do with any history regarding food and the culture surrounding it. In addition to history, I enjoy watching and understanding media analysis to gain new perspectives or learn new things about my favourite media. One of my favourite channels I recommend anyone to watch would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AccentedCinema">Accented Cinema</a> if anyone else was interested. Lastly, I hold a lot of interest in Anime and Manga, with my favourite manga being Bungou Stray Dogs. I even attend conventions, like the image on the left being from MadMan Festival and taking photos with famous YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yourchonny">MyChonny</a>. </p>
