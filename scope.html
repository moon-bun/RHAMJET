          <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">PROGRAMMING ABILITY CONSTRAINTS</h1>
    <p>
      The biggest constraint that RHAMJET will need to consider for the development of its deliverables is the technical ability of its team members. Although Mobile Application development is not a recent advancement, as the team members responsible for developing the deliverable are only first year students at university, we have no prior experience in developing a mobile application and thus are having to completely learn Java from scratch in a new environment of Android Studio in order to deliver our biggest deliverable. The initial strategy is to learn enough Java to understand the mechanics of the language and get by with using premade code from online resources (complete with credits) to substitute for the actual code in order to create a proper prototype. <br> <br>
      Additionally, AR technology is highly experimental and still developing and as such programming such software may be an impossibility with our technical level. The consensus for dealing with this constraint is to use prebuilt AR software that allows us to customise the image shown and demonstrate the “what” aspect of the function rather than the “how”. This way, the deliverable can be made on time with what skill we have rather than try to build from scratch.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="time">
    <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">TIME CONSTRAINTS</h1>
    <p>The next major constraint given to RHAMJET was having four weeks in developing and prototyping deliverables as well as typing, editing and formatting a report as part of those deliverables. The current strategy employed is to divide the work between the technical aspects (I.e., handling the development and written aspects pertaining to the report sections that deal with how the progress went) and the research aspects (describing the project itself as well as handling extra research such as required roles for a hypothetical final product) and progress from there. This strategy is not strict in its enforcement, as we expect to ask each other for help and have some crossovers in terms of writing and communication.
      <br>
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="equipment">
        <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">EQUIPMENT CONSTRAINTS</h1>
    <p>All members of RHAMJET have access to adequate equipment for the purposes of the project, having word processors and software for communication and working on the report aspect of the project. However, the software development team will need to work around working on the major technical aspects on their home PC’s and working off their laptops while away for other aspects, as laptops generally aren’t powerful enough to handle things like Adobe software. As well, by nature of developing a mobile application requires using mobile devices for testing purposes, which imposes its own constraints as some team member’s phones are old or don’t have enough storage space for our needs and thus must be worked around. <br>
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="resource">
    <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">RESOURCE CONSTRAINT</h1>
    <p>Since RHAMJET only consists of seven individuals with very limited experience in practically any of the required fields required for the project, and of the seven half of use are assigned purely to report writing for the first 2 weeks of the assignment which means a slower start for the development process. This combined with our lack of experience severely limits us on the scope of our deliverables, as such we have decided to settle for a modest three deliverables as of now for the sake of our team members as this project is quite ambitious for our current skill level.<br> <br>
    As RHAMJET only consists of seven individuals in terms of manpower and majority have been delegated tasks regarding report writing and research, only leaves three people to manage the development of the deliverables and thus severely restrains us on the scope of our deliverable and what can be made with other constraints in consideration. As such, a modest three deliverables have been decided for the sake of our team members as the functions themselves are ambitious enough for our skill level.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cost">
    <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">COST CONSTRAINT</h1>
    <p>RHAMJET intends not to spend any money whatsoever on the development of the project, resulting in a reliance on open-source and free software to avoid incurring any costs on our nonexistent budget. This severely limits what we can deliver in terms of functionality as specific features may be restricted to paid versions or have some functionality that makes developing our deliverables easier.

    <div class="deliverables">
    <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">DELIVERABLES</h1>
      <h4>AR COMPONENT</h4>
    <p> <i>A working mobile application capable of displaying an augmented reality image on the phone’s camera</i> <br>
      The utmost priority is displaying an augmented image on a camera phone, with the caveat that the display image would be hard coded into the demonstration for the sake of simplicity and with consideration to the constraints in place
    </p>
  <img src="TestImages/ProjectImages/arcomponent.jpg" alt="yeppers" style="float:center; width:1000px; height="auto"">
    <h4>QR SCANNER COMPONENT</h4>
    <p> <i>A Functional QR Code and Scanner </i> <br>
      Second Priority would be to get the QR Code working that can deliver the scanner to a website as proof of concept. One idea could be to have the QR code lead to RHAMJET website hidden page that would serve as the testing site. Alternatively, it would be a different website that replicates a hypothetical recreation of what scanning a QR code would be like in the final product
      <br>
      Addendum – If enough time is left to allow for this, we can attempt to combine the deliverables 1 and 2 to see if a functional prototype and the main draw of the project can be achieved
    </p>

      <h4>UI MOCK-UP</h4>
      <p> <i>UI Mock-Up of the Project </i> <br>
      Least Priority of the deliverables but a low fidelity prototype of the UI would help shape and display the game aspect of the project best <br>
      If the team members dedicated to technology are completely swamped with first two deliverables, will ask team members delegated to working on the report writing to help assist with this deliverable if necessary.
