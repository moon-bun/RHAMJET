        <h1>GROUP PROCESSES</h1>
        <p>In Assignment 2, RHAMJET managed to have effective communication through the group and between each member individually. RHAMJET communicates through several ways including messages, meetings, and face to face interaction.  </p>
        <p>RHAMJET’s meetings occur three times each week, including two online meetings via Microsoft Teams and one face-to-face meeting which happened to be at the tutorial on Thursday. To make sure that most of our group members are able to attend these online meetings, the day and time were discussed within group members on Discord. All our online meetings were recorded; therefore, members can look back at those meetings if they could not attend or simply ask anyone from the group for updated information or changes that happened during the meetings. In our meetings, each member will have a one to two minutes talk to share their progress with others since the last meeting, problems that any team members are facing or information that needs clarifications and agreement from other team members will also be discussed during the meeting. </p>
        <p>In Assignment 3, RHAMJET will maintain the same way to communicate within the group as in Assignment 2, which are messages, online meetings, and face to face interactions. Meetings will be more flexible due to group members might have to spend time catching up on another assignment as it is coming to the end of this semester, or to avoid have two meetings are too close to each other so members would not have many progresses to report, the day and time for meetings will be discussed within the group as before. </p>
