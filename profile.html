      <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
      <p>It is consensus among RHAMJET members that MBTI is a largely baseless pseudoscience. Owing to lack of significant scientific evidence, mistrust in the creators of the theory, general scepticism, or a combination of. However, there is some merit to be found - and assuming the previous tests are accurate, the following is how we hypothesize team RHAMJET would work together. </p>
      <p>We have a nice mix of types, learning styles, and no overtly conflicting personalities. This variety means team RHAMJET has many perspectives to offer for every intricacy of our assignment.  </p>
      <p>The group is primarily made up of introverts, with only two extroverts among us (Roma and Tyler). In theory this should lead to stagnant group meetings and difficulty communicating. However, in practice we’ve made great progress in meetings and communicate to an exceptional degree. </p>
      <p>Much of the team is prospective (a 1 to 3 ratio, the same found in extroverts vs introverts). This could lead to an unstructured, unorganized workflow, but would also mean a high degree of flexibility in our planning. Regardless, our judging personalities should act as enough of an anchor to keep us on track regarding deadlines. </p>
      <p>The variety of different learning styles and how we prefer to apply ourselves means we have many options in how we as team can approach a task. Each member will grasp different areas of a problem, and collaboration will only make us better. </p>

        <h1>GROUP PROCESSES</h1>
        <p>In Assignment 2, RHAMJET managed to have effective communication through the group and between each member individually. RHAMJET communicates through several ways including messages, meetings, and face to face interaction.  </p>
        <p>RHAMJET’s meetings occur three times each week, including two online meetings via Microsoft Teams and one face-to-face meeting which happened to be at the tutorial on Thursday. To make sure that most of our group members are able to attend these online meetings, the day and time were discussed within group members on Discord. All our online meetings were recorded; therefore, members can look back at those meetings if they could not attend or simply ask anyone from the group for updated information or changes that happened during the meetings. In our meetings, each member will have a one to two minutes talk to share their progress with others since the last meeting, problems that any team members are facing or information that needs clarifications and agreement from other team members will also be discussed during the meeting. </p>
        <p>In Assignment 3, RHAMJET will maintain the same way to communicate within the group as in Assignment 2, which are messages, online meetings, and face to face interactions. Meetings will be more flexible due to group members might have to spend time catching up on another assignment as it is coming to the end of this semester, or to avoid have two meetings are too close to each other so members would not have many progresses to report, the day and time for meetings will be discussed within the group as before. </p>

          <p>In analyzing the group’s preferred jobs, the most common factor is software development and the programming languages that are in demand, such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, being highly coveted by companies. However, it is the type of software and the sectors that differ from all of us. Some of us will be working with the more corporate side of things, working on back-end development for large companies or start-ups. This would entail providing infrastructure for the company’s data management systems, creating mobile applications, setting up cloud services or ensuring that all their operating systems can run smoothly and efficiently. </p>
          <p>ur other members will be working on other areas of software development. Mobile gaming development is an ever-expanding field with a plethora of opportunities to choose from. We may contribute to the science industry, helping expand the biomedical field and help combat diseases or make scientific breakthroughs. Or we may help serve the country, tinker, and masterfully engineer more high-tech military systems, working in the R&D branch.  </p>
          <p>The career plans of our group are realistic and achievable with enough effort put in, as many of us want to find work in jobs that help serve users and people whether it be for science, defence, or general usage. Most of us intend to work in jobs that belong to the private sector, but there is an exception with Tyler, who plans to serve the public in the military as a systems engineer. </p>
