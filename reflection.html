       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align:left" > RHAMJET kept to the biweekly meeting requirements. No team member missed more than two meetings, and everyone made as much effort to attend, even if they had personal matters to attend to. Work was allocated in the first week and was uploaded to the MS Teams shared doc promptly for peer review. When we originally allocated tasks, we found that some of our team members had too much work on their hand, therefore we had to reallocate the tasks equally. Ultimately, we did well splitting workload fairly and ensuring everyone contributed equally. A progress update was included in the agenda every week, so we were always up to date on each other’s situations.<br><br>

      An aspect RHAMJET can improve on is more effectively managing our time. Initially we set no deadlines until late in the assignment, therefore next time we should set deadlines at the very beginning of the assignment. Group meetings were always very informal, and while we did our writing and team meetings on MS Teams, we also had a RHAMJET Discord. In communication we were often side-tracked by socializing. While this helped the group harmony and having a clear communication, it affected workflow and we still had everyone had different views on the project idea. We didn’t catch on to everyone’s confusion regarding the project idea until the later weeks. In future we should check in on each other not just for the work we’re personally responsible for, but that everyone has a clear understanding of each other’s work and what’s going on in the project holistically.<br><br>

      No one in RHAMJET liked the meeting requirements initially. We were all surprised by how helpful they were with getting progress updates from each member on the individual tasks and discussing different components of the assignment. The meetings worked to hold us accountable. We found as a group we got quite a bit of work done through having an equal balance of formality and informality to keep our work on progress, which was also unexpected.<br><br>

      Ultimately, RHAMJET has learned that being in a group is fun when each team member is cohesively and consistently contributing. It made things easier once we knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses where we could work around it. We allocated tasks in accordance with each member of RHAMJET’s strengths. We learned skills and techniques about working in groups that we can all take into later courses and future careers. <br>  </p>

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left"> RHAMJET made a perfect group while working on Assignment 2. At first, it was slow in getting things started and communicating with each other. However, once we started to know one another and each other's strengths and weaknesses we managed to have a good progress on the work set. Each meeting there was good communication on getting to know how well each teammate is going and if they required any help. Everyone filled in the gaps of one another where an individual lacked in skills which was very beneficial. As a group, we can improve on staying focused on what we have scheduled for each meeting and leave the off-topic conversation after the recording is ended. This was due to getting off topic for a few minutes while the recording was on. Another improvement that can be made is trying to have a common agreement in what we discuss as we had multiple views on the project idea. RHAMJET managed to work efficiently and effectively even through the few misunderstandings that were existent. Each member of RHAMJET got roughly equal amount of work which made it easier for everyone and having a large group was very good for splitting the tasks.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">   Working with RHAMJET on Assignment 2 is enjoyable, everyone is doing their work. Having group meetings twice every week was very helpful for everyone to catch up with the work and communicate with each other. Like we were having different ideas for our Project, discussing in the meeting can help us get our idea come together. However, keeping the group meeting is important so we can be working efficiently. Compared to small groups, working with a larger one meant members got smaller workloads and had time and energy to make our contents better. One thing I learned as working in a group, if anyone notices any problems, other group members can give advice or solutions to solve them in the first place. One thing that surprised me is for the group meetings, everyone tried their best to attend all the scheduled meetings, none of us missed more than two of the meetings. It is good to get to know each other's strengths so that they might be able to be assigned to the works they good at doing.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  Working with RHAMJET overall was a unique experience where we were able to meet, understand and work efficiently with each other in a limited time frame. Though at first, we had a bit of time to get the ball rolling, I think because we were trying to get to know each other however we were quick to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of our team members. What went well I would say is that each member had a similar work ethic, and we all were on track for the most part to the same goal. Now that we know each other, we could improve on better planning from the start and work at a constant pace, that is we need our own soft deadlines to better keep us in track rather than have moments where we feel like to cram. I found it surprising that we could all easily agree on the task delegation, and we all supported each other when required.  I learned that we can all work efficiently since we have the same target.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  RHAMJET is the largest group I’ve worked on a project with. Overall, we are a functional team. Levels of attendance, communication, and involvement remained high for the duration of the project. We were always up to date with each other's situations and informed on each other's progress regarding assignment 2. Individual work went well, but problems arose regarding collaborative processes. We had difficulty coming together on a singular idea for our Project Idea until the later weeks. In future we should take measures to improve on this. I was surprised by how easy it was to work in large group and meet with them twice a week. I normally don’t enjoy large amounts of social interaction, but working with RHAMJET was pleasant. I didn’t mind the half-hour weekly meetings.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  During the weeks I spent working with RHAMJET, I feel that we were successful in our endeavours working on Assessment 2. At the beginning of the project, I felt that we were slow in starting on work which in my opinion was something that could be improved as every time we needed to start a new task assigned to us, we would delay starting it by a day.  What was done well was our attendance and constant communication/contribution to the project, we consistently attended group meetings set up despite our circumstances (some of us had jobs/family commitments) and as such helped ensure our workflow was consistent and everyone understood their roles and tasks.  <br><br>

       What I learnt from working in this group is that striking a balance of formality and casualness helped the group perform better as everyone could be relaxed about their work rather than stilted and forced that would lead to solitary work rather than working as a group. What did surprise me was that I took up a role as a coordinator within the group, as the 2nd meeting demonstrated that the group was aimless without me helping direct and push the group forward in discussion.

       At the beginning of this project, it was a bit of a daunting idea to be working and collaborating with other people who I’ve only known for a couple of days. However, what I’ve come to find out is that working in a team has been quite a rewarding experience, in terms of my work ethic and my attitude towards it. Elements that worked well in the team was us having a great work drive towards the project. We all had a hand in chipping away at every aspect of the project, and we were all very assertive in offering assistance and constructive criticism to whoever needed it. An aspect that could’ve been improved was setting stronger deadlines, as we loosely followed a submission timeframe. Something that surprised me was the group meetings. It was something I absolutely was not looking forward to, however it was extremely useful in keeping me on track. A thing I've learned about groups is that they're vital for the proliferation of ideas.

        I feel like our team synergised really well, we had full attendance in our meetings most of the time and most of our meetings were fairly productive, although we did go off track fairly often with our banter. As for work most of the time we held each other slightly accountable and were supportive of each other when we needed help. One thing I found surprising about our team was how casual our team was, rather than being stressed about each meeting or feeling resentment about having to attend them, I was kinda happy as every meeting was always fairly entertaining. One thing I learnt about team was the importance of good leadership, as demonstrated when our team ‘leader’ (unofficial but we all knew it(Jamie)) wasn’t present and that meeting was way less structured (although we still discussed everything required).
