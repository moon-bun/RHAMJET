       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align:left" > In Assignment 3, we had split RHAMJET into two teams: research team and tech team. Having these two teams allowed individuals to focus on their component that they preferred and help others in their smaller team. Another good aspect in working through this assignment was the fact that a majority of RHAMJET were taking on more responsibilities than they were required to. This was beneficial as it reduced workload from another team member so they could focus more specifically and openly to the task they were working on. An improvement that was made from assignment 2 was setting deadlines on when certain things were due. This encouraged each team member to know and understand the pace and time needed to get their task done.  <br><br>



Even though having split RHAMJET into two teams had good benefits, it also brought communication issues between them. Throughout these last few weeks either team had a minimal understanding on what the other team was working on. This majorly came aware where the research team wanted to do some tasks such as the plans and progress for the tech team.  When separating each task between the research team and tech team we didn’t correctly assume the amount of work each team got. We originally set work to what tasks had more research to the research team and the more tech side of the report was given to the tech team. However, as time went on, we had realised that the tech team had more work in comparison to the research team. The research team had their tasks done in the early weeks of the assignment. Despite this the research team took on more responsibilities to help the tech team finish their sections in the report. But for next time, we should appropriately measure the number of tasks given to each team and individually.  <br><br>



RHAMJET was surprised on the difficultly that software development brought while implementing our deliverables. We had allocated Jamie and Abel to work on our deliverables however this was regretful as these team members had put in so much effort and time into. Both had to learn a new programming language before they could work on the deliverable. So, we all realised that having two people working on programming the application was not enough and that more team members should have been in the process of developing the application.  <br><br>



RHAMJET learnt that having set a soft deadline led to more efficiency in each team member to get required things done and it also made our final week less busy compared to our last week of assignment 2. We learnt on how to work in a group through a different approach which we can take into consideration in our future life.    </p>

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left"> RHAMJET took feedback and mistakes done in assignment 2 into consideration and improved it for assignment 3. We had more communication happening in the group, so everyone was on the same idea and pace throughout the assignment. By the end of assignment 2, the group had a better understanding on each team members strengths and weaknesses. Thus, when delegating task, we kept each other strengths and weaknesses in mind so that this assignment each team member is doing what they enjoy and get a best outcome from each member. When delegating tasks, we had split the team into a research team and a tech team. Having these two teams allowed everyone to focus on their tasks and other tasks that they can contribute to. However, there was a bit of lack in our communication between the two groups. Team members in the research team did not have a clear understanding on the tasks the tech team were doing and vice versa. This led to problems when the research team wanted to take responsibility on helping the tech team write up their delegated report section. The fact that majority of the team members took the extra responsibility to do extra work that was not assigned to them originally so there was not much of a big load on any team member towards the end of the assignment.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">   On top of Assignment 2, RHAMJET learned from the mistakes and worked together to bring a better result as Assignment 3. During all the time we worked together as a team, we get to know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and assigned work for every team member according to those strengths. In Assignment 3, we split the team into the research group and the technical group, and this turned out to be worthwhile, that two groups did well in each other’s area. However, having two separate group caused the deficiency of communication compared to Assignment 2 where all the team members worked together as a whole group, especially the technical group were reaching out to work with new applications and programming languages which the researchers are not familiar with. Keeping the habit of meeting multiple times each week, online and face-to-face helped us to reduce the misinformation between groups. But compared to meetings appended during Assignment 2, meetings time were changed for Assignment 3 that sometimes two meetings are too close to each other, and members did have many progresses to report. Overall, everyone in the team did a great job, finished their assigned works on time, or even beforehand, and supported each other.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  Assignment 3 was technical and had a lot more involved compared to assignment 2 however everyone in the group did a great job in taking leadership in their strengths. The idea of splitting the group into two groups, the research team and tech team, was a great idea as we were able to focus on tasks that were related to each other which helped us to efficiently complete tasks in a high standard. For improvement I think we should have better communication between the two groups as to grasp a better understanding of the progress that is being made. Everyone in the team did a good job in supporting each other as this assignment did require us to leave our comfort zone and apply skills gained, example can be developing the artifacts as they were developed on Java and Kotlin and we were never taught how to program with it. It was a good idea to provide information to the report writers about the progress of the artifact development as this allowed the artifacts to be developed without any other stress. Overall, I think we did improve from last assignment

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  Overall RHAMJET worked well together. Group participation for assignment 3 was just high as it was for assignment 2.  We had a better idea of each other’s strengths and weaknesses going into Assignment 3 and took that into account assigning work between us. The decision to split the group into a tech and research group had surprising results. It let people focus on their strengths like we intended and worked well overall but caused communication errors between us. I often felt like the two groups didn’t have a clear idea of what the other group was doing, and the cohesion of the project as a whole suffered. Our inexperience with IT also led to the distribution of workloads being very disproportionate. We underestimated the amount of work that would be involved in creating the artifacts, and the Tech team ended up having to do more work than was perhaps fair. Meetings had less direction than in Assignment 2. Despite this, I think our teamwork has improved from assignment 2. The implementation of clear deadlines made a big difference as well. The last week of assignment 3 has been less rushed than in assignment 2, and I feel I’ve learnt the importance of both soft and hard deadlines during these weeks.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left"> For Assignment 3, I believe the group went as well as Assignment 2 for doing work and working together to finish the assignment. As Assignment 3 required a lot more effort into technical work and the project, I believe our early delegation of work helped pave a path towards completion and kept it clear what each team member needed to do which kept us on task. Additionally, I believe each individual member of the team stepped up a lot more and took on more responsibilities, so that was welcome change from Assignment 2. I think what could’ve improved was the amount of communication we had, as meetings this time around was a bit more stagnant and unclear unlike Assignment 2, with a lack of agendas and commenting to keep track of decisions. <br>
       Additionally, we also misjudged the amount of work necessary for completion as the report tasks were completed way earlier than the deliverables and thus the members responsible for the report had finished earlier than expected. From this, I’ve learnt how valuable agendas and having a point of group meetings were to getting value out of them. What surprised me however was how much documenting the technical development required.

       One of the main gripes back in Assignment 2 was a lack of a clear deadline. To circumvent this, at the beginning of this project we assigned roles and responsibilities to every team member, and set up some deadlines through the use of an external app, Trello. However, the use of this app fell off during the later weeks. There was also an issue of some people having a little more to do on their hands. What I didn’t expect was the amount of work that we required to do. People in the tech department seemed to have a disproportionate amount of work to complete, needing to learn entirely new software within the span of 3 weeks and to deliver a presentable artifact in time, not to mention having to do some writing up for their parts. In comparison, the research department finished up their sections relatively quickly, so they needed to chip in to help with the tech people. I myself was part of the writing team, so after I finished it was decided that I should also work on another deliverable, which was a wise idea. A thing I’ve learned during this assignment was finding out the importance of delegating different tasks to different people. This allows for an efficient workflow and lets people work to their strengths.

        For assignment 3 I think our group performed just about as well as we did in assignment 2 apart from our communication, since the way we delegated our work left us with 2 distinctive “groups” within our group, half on research and the other half on tech. This made our members communicate progress mostly within our individual “groups” rather than in our group as a whole, although this definitely did Impede our communication it didn’t really affect our overall work apart from a few assumptions here and there when writing about the other groups work. Apart from that, I believe that we all worked well together again although in our individual “groups, most people volunteered to complete extra work on top of their pre-assigned work at the start of the assignment, such as Elliot volunteering to make the Figma prototype. Our meetings went off track a lot less than they did in assignment 2 although they went for noticeably less time on average, compared to assignment 2 meetings, although that might not be a bad thing to be honest.
