       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align:left" > RHAMJET kept to the biweekly meeting requirements. No team member missed more than two meetings, and everyone made as much effort to attend, even if they had personal matters to attend to. Work was allocated in the first week and was uploaded to the MS Teams shared doc promptly for peer review. When we originally allocated tasks, we found that some of our team members had too much work on their hand, therefore we had to reallocate the tasks equally. Ultimately, we did well splitting workload fairly and ensuring everyone contributed equally. A progress update was included in the agenda every week, so we were always up to date on each other’s situations.<br><br>

      An aspect RHAMJET can improve on is more effectively managing our time. Initially we set no deadlines until late in the assignment, therefore next time we should set deadlines at the very beginning of the assignment. Group meetings were always very informal, and while we did our writing and team meetings on MS Teams, we also had a RHAMJET Discord. In communication we were often side-tracked by socializing. While this helped the group harmony and having a clear communication, it affected workflow and we still had everyone had different views on the project idea. We didn’t catch on to everyone’s confusion regarding the project idea until the later weeks. In future we should check in on each other not just for the work we’re personally responsible for, but that everyone has a clear understanding of each other’s work and what’s going on in the project holistically.<br><br>

      No one in RHAMJET liked the meeting requirements initially. We were all surprised by how helpful they were with getting progress updates from each member on the individual tasks and discussing different components of the assignment. The meetings worked to hold us accountable. We found as a group we got quite a bit of work done through having an equal balance of formality and informality to keep our work on progress, which was also unexpected.<br><br>

      Ultimately, RHAMJET has learned that being in a group is fun when each team member is cohesively and consistently contributing. It made things easier once we knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses where we could work around it. We allocated tasks in accordance with each member of RHAMJET’s strengths. We learned skills and techniques about working in groups that we can all take into later courses and future careers. <br>  </p>

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left"> RHAMJET made a perfect group while working on Assignment 2. At first, it was slow in getting things started and communicating with each other. However, once we started to know one another and each other's strengths and weaknesses we managed to have a good progress on the work set. Each meeting there was good communication on getting to know how well each teammate is going and if they required any help. Everyone filled in the gaps of one another where an individual lacked in skills which was very beneficial. As a group, we can improve on staying focused on what we have scheduled for each meeting and leave the off-topic conversation after the recording is ended. This was due to getting off topic for a few minutes while the recording was on. Another improvement that can be made is trying to have a common agreement in what we discuss as we had multiple views on the project idea. RHAMJET managed to work efficiently and effectively even through the few misunderstandings that were existent. Each member of RHAMJET got roughly equal amount of work which made it easier for everyone and having a large group was very good for splitting the tasks.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">   Working with RHAMJET on Assignment 2 is enjoyable, everyone is doing their work. Having group meetings twice every week was very helpful for everyone to catch up with the work and communicate with each other. Like we were having different ideas for our Project, discussing in the meeting can help us get our idea come together. However, keeping the group meeting is important so we can be working efficiently. Compared to small groups, working with a larger one meant members got smaller workloads and had time and energy to make our contents better. One thing I learned as working in a group, if anyone notices any problems, other group members can give advice or solutions to solve them in the first place. One thing that surprised me is for the group meetings, everyone tried their best to attend all the scheduled meetings, none of us missed more than two of the meetings. It is good to get to know each other's strengths so that they might be able to be assigned to the works they good at doing.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  Assignment 3 was technical and had a lot more involved compared to assignment 2 however everyone in the group did a great job in taking leadership in their strengths. The idea of splitting the group into two groups, the research team and tech team, was a great idea as we were able to focus on tasks that were related to each other which helped us to efficiently complete tasks in a high standard. For improvement I think we should have better communication between the two groups as to grasp a better understanding of the progress that is being made. Everyone in the team did a good job in supporting each other as this assignment did require us to leave our comfort zone and apply skills gained, example can be developing the artifacts as they were developed on Java and Kotlin and we were never taught how to program with it. It was a good idea to provide information to the report writers about the progress of the artifact development as this allowed the artifacts to be developed without any other stress. Overall, I think we did improve from last assignment

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  RHAMJET is the largest group I’ve worked on a project with. Overall, we are a functional team. Levels of attendance, communication, and involvement remained high for the duration of the project. We were always up to date with each other's situations and informed on each other's progress regarding assignment 2. Individual work went well, but problems arose regarding collaborative processes. We had difficulty coming together on a singular idea for our Project Idea until the later weeks. In future we should take measures to improve on this. I was surprised by how easy it was to work in large group and meet with them twice a week. I normally don’t enjoy large amounts of social interaction, but working with RHAMJET was pleasant. I didn’t mind the half-hour weekly meetings.

       <p style= "color: #000000; font-size: 14px; text-align: left">  During the weeks I spent working with RHAMJET, I feel that we were successful in our endeavours working on Assessment 2. At the beginning of the project, I felt that we were slow in starting on work which in my opinion was something that could be improved as every time we needed to start a new task assigned to us, we would delay starting it by a day.  What was done well was our attendance and constant communication/contribution to the project, we consistently attended group meetings set up despite our circumstances (some of us had jobs/family commitments) and as such helped ensure our workflow was consistent and everyone understood their roles and tasks.  <br><br>

       What I learnt from working in this group is that striking a balance of formality and casualness helped the group perform better as everyone could be relaxed about their work rather than stilted and forced that would lead to solitary work rather than working as a group. What did surprise me was that I took up a role as a coordinator within the group, as the 2nd meeting demonstrated that the group was aimless without me helping direct and push the group forward in discussion.

       One of the main gripes back in Assignment 2 was a lack of a clear deadline. To circumvent this, at the beginning of this project we assigned roles and responsibilities to every team member, and set up some deadlines through the use of an external app, Trello. However, the use of this app fell off during the later weeks. There was also an issue of some people having a little more to do on their hands. What I didn’t expect was the amount of work that we required to do. People in the tech department seemed to have a disproportionate amount of work to complete, needing to learn entirely new software within the span of 3 weeks and to deliver a presentable artifact in time, not to mention having to do some writing up for their parts. In comparison, the research department finished up their sections relatively quickly, so they needed to chip in to help with the tech people. I myself was part of the writing team, so after I finished it was decided that I should also work on another deliverable, which was a wise idea. A thing I’ve learned during this assignment was finding out the importance of delegating different tasks to different people. This allows for an efficient workflow and lets people work to their strengths.

        I feel like our team synergised really well, we had full attendance in our meetings most of the time and most of our meetings were fairly productive, although we did go off track fairly often with our banter. As for work most of the time we held each other slightly accountable and were supportive of each other when we needed help. One thing I found surprising about our team was how casual our team was, rather than being stressed about each meeting or feeling resentment about having to attend them, I was kinda happy as every meeting was always fairly entertaining. One thing I learnt about team was the importance of good leadership, as demonstrated when our team ‘leader’ (unofficial but we all knew it(Jamie)) wasn’t present and that meeting was way less structured (although we still discussed everything required).
