          <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>

          <div class='CC1'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Overview</h4>
            <p>Cloud Computing is defined as “the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet” (Microsoft, section Benefits), with a multitude of services in a post-Covid world available for any users, both business and individual to use. The most recognized application of Cloud Computing to the average person in 2022 would be for data storage, such as OneDrive and iCloud, which has the functionality to store files ranging from images to databases on a remote server. Other applications of cloud technology are: </p>
            <div class='CClist1'>
              <ul>
                <li>Streaming Services, which offers users new ways of consuming media content on demand. Examples of services taking advantage of cloud computing include Twitch, which allows users to livestream and interact with people watching in real time, Netflix, which allows users to watch any media content from their library on demand and on multiple devices, and Spotify, which allows users to listen to music on demand as well from anywhere without needing to download it.</li>
                <li>Communication Services connect users from any location with an internet connection. Examples of this service are Zoom and FaceTime, which use cloud-computing to send input data such as sound and camera footage to a server and distribute it on the other end of the call. </li>
                <li>Digital Distribution is increasingly using cloud-technology to distribute digital content, whether it be services like Steam providing a store interface to purchase and download games without owning a physical copy or install updates for live services. Also, they can facilitate live-service gaming, such as Massive Multiplayer Online games or Free to Play games (examples being World of Warcraft, Fortnite or Genshin Impact) by allowing users to play together. </li>
                <li>Cloud VPN, a specific type of VPN that, according to Techopedia, “utilises a cloud-based network infrastructure to deliver VPN services” (Section “What does Cloud VPN mean”) and thus is more flexible as it doesn’t rely on the user having a VPN infrastructure on their end.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>These applications all share the primary benefits of flexibility and affordability, as cloud computing puts the work in remote servers that belong to the service rather than requiring the users to have specific requirements.</p>
            <p>However, while the concept of cloud computing had existed ever since the days of ARPANET, it would only become widespread for businesses once Amazon had launched Amazon Web Services in 2006, which offered third parties a “variety of cloud-based services including storage, computation and ‘human intelligence’.” (Keith D. Foote December 17, 2021, Section The Early 2000s) as well as renting data centers and virtual machines which would lead to the idea of Software as a Service (SaaS) to sell cloud computing. After 2010, other companies would begin to offer their own cloud services to use, such as OpenStack, ICloud and the IBM SmartCloud but it would be OracleCloud that would offer the three recognisable models of a cloud service, like Software as a Service but additionally Infrastructure as a Service (offer the building blocks of cloud computing and allow developers to build their own), Platform As a Service (offers a baseline infrastructure so developers can build and bundle their software) and Data as a Service (offers an aggregation of data from users for developers to utilise for their own needs).  Thanks to the Covid-19 Global Pandemic forcing everyone into quarantine, cloud computing became almost ubiquitous overnight, as cloud services became widely in demand such as Zoom due to their flexibility to allow users to study and work from home and greatly accelerated development into cloud computing. </p>
            <p>As such, the predicted forecast of what cloud computing can do in the next three years are: </p>
            <div class='CClist2'>
              <ul>
                <li>Further refinement of a 5th type of Service Model, the Workstation as a Service (WaaS), allowing users to remotely access applications and information from whatever device is available on which coincides in the rising demand for work-from-home benefits in jobs.</li>
                <li>Open-Source Cloud Computing which would allow businesses to not be locked into one cloud service provider and be only capable of using that vendor exclusively as well as save costs by not having to pay high fees.</li>
                <li>More emphasis on eCommerce as a model for many businesses going forward as using cloud computing for a store front brought convenience on the users end and allowed purchases to be made without ever needing to go outside. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class='CC2'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Likely Impact</h4>
            <p>In the ever-expanding field of information technology, new advancements are constantly being made. One such is the shift of allowing open-source cloud computing to be made available to businesses. Data is a valuable resource where corporations must effectively use and transform it into usable data. This “’Proliferation of data,’ means businesses increasingly need common digital data standards” (Duncan.M, 2022, Cloud Tech) if they are to gather more consumers and expand their business practices. To achieve this, several companies have banded together to create a “Data Cloud Alliance”. What this aims to accomplish is improving how data is currently used, as well as increasing access to it. This is done through allowing data to be compatible with multiple platforms and just overall improving the handling of data, “data governance, data privacy, data loss prevention, and global compliance” (Duncan.M, 2022). This would benefit businesses, improving their transformation of data. Consumers would mainly benefit from having improved user experiences, such as increasing the accessibility of e-commerce models to users. </p>
            <p>There is another development soon to come, Workstation as a Service (WaaS), which is a new type of service model. This model is gradually being adopted across workplaces and education settings and has the potential to fundamentally change how we approach working. With Covid-19 forcing everyone to live in isolation, the work from home approach has become a wildly adopted method. The way WaaS works is through having a workspace provider, such as Microsoft, hosting software on their own servers where the user can access these workspaces on their own devices. WaaS has immense potential in affecting the standards of how we work and where it brings benefits, such as allowing workers and users to “Work from anywhere,” “Get secure digital workspaces,” “reduce office costs,” “Customize your workspace solutions,” “work uninterrupted” (Ace cloud hosting editor, 2020). Workstation as a Service would likely bring a lot of flexibility into the workflow of a user, allowing the same benefits experienced in Work-From-Home set ups such as more free time, better mental wellbeing as well as cutting down on commute times. </p>
          </div>

          <div class='CC3'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">How will this affect you:</h4>
            <p>The advancements in cloud technology are already noticeable to the average user and has come to be seen as a necessity. The WaaS model is already being utilised by students through applications such as Microsoft Teams. This comes with a wide range of benefits, one which allows students the freedom of working from wherever, whenever with an internet connection. With the current state of the pandemic, working from home is almost a necessity, as well as being very convenient. Many workplaces are starting to adopt working from home as a viable method of running things, as people are beginning to realize the convenience of it. Organizations can set up digital workspaces within a provider and customize it to suit the user’s needs. WaaS offers users' access to applications they couldn’t run, preventing the need for them to purchase and download superfluous apps of which may never be used, everything will be provided to us by the workstation host. This is immensely helpful to a lot of people, as many of us come from different financial backgrounds, where the pandemic would have disrupted the livelihoods of many, so this is a welcome feature. Many applications also go by a subscription-based model, so it’s nice to avoid it whenever possible. As everything is hosted on the service provider’s servers, there comes a risk of the servers being down for maintenance, becoming compromised from malicious attacks or other external factors. </p>
            <p>With the advent of open-source cloud computing, businesses may see a great surge in development of business infrastructure and customer data analytics. As customers, we would most likely receive more personalized user experiences with using the services of these businesses, online shopping as an example. Many people are preferring an online shopping experience as opposed to doing physical shopping, as during the pandemic, online commerce “grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales” (Maryville University, first paragraph), so corporations have started to shape and manipulate our shopping experiences, with help from open-source cloud computing. What we should expect from this development is a very personalized, and maybe unsettling shopping experience where the system will try to market relevant products to you. </p>

          <h2>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h2>

          <div class='vrar1'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Overview</h4>
            <p>Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are two very popular technologies of the modern era. Both share the similar goal to enhance the world around us by tracking the perspective of the user in real time and overlaying it with digital objects either in their current view (AR) or generating a different world which can be interacted through various input methods (VR). (credits: digitalartsonline.co.uk).  AR and VR have advanced so much that it has become possible for the general consumer to try out and experience what both these technologies have to offer from home.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='vrar2'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Current Uses</h4>

            <div class='arvrlist1'>
              <p>Many day-to-day uses of AR can be seen as applications which interact with the world around the user through the camera of a smartphone. These can be through: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pokémon Go, a free to play mobile game that incorporates augmented reality to combine the world of Pokémon into the real world by spawning various characters on screen and encouraging players to catch them.  To further enhance the experience, the game takes advantage of the devices’ GPS and clock to expand the spawn point of certain Pokémon which makes users to move around to catch Pokémon's, like the trainers seen in the show. </li>
                <li>AR rulers which use the camera of a smartphone to measure end points of an object relative to other 3D objects surrounding in its environment.</li>
                <li>Morden airliners and jets including augmented reality using a heads-up display (HUD) to calculate airspeed, altitude, pitch, roll, yawn, and other information which are displayed on the cockpit instruments. All this will be displayed on a transparent glass in line with the pilot’s vision.  </li>
              </ul>
            <p>For VR, many applications can be seen used in everyday lives and many used at an industrial level. Such examples are:  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>VR gaming, modern titles Microsoft flight simulator and Gran Turismo Sport officially support VR. To the player this means that they can experience a game as if they are in that environment.  </li>
                <li>Military and medical industries can benefit the use of VR by training people do deal with various situations in a safe environment. They also reduce the total cost of training.  </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class='arvr3'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Future of AR and VR</h4>
            <p>With devices such as the HoloLens from Microsoft and Google Glass, the adoption of augmented reality will be popular with a wide range of industries in the future.  </p>
            <div class='arvrlist3'>
              <ul>
                <li>A good example can be education as classrooms become more engaging and immersive, augmented reality allows a new level of interaction for students. </li>
                <li>Augmented reality will be popular choice to visualise in real time; this can be in a form of interior design where it can be cheaper to design with AR rather than a designer. AR designs can also help clients to better understand the idea of the design. (credit: loopphonebooths.com)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Not only for gaming, but virtual reality also allows the flexibility to create various environments to run a range of scenarios. These can be useful in different workforces, such examples are:</p>
            <div class='arvrlist4'>
              <ul>
                <li>Virtual reality allows engineers to design 3D models and test their concept in a safe environment, allowing them to pick out any flaws and risks in the system before proceeding. The benefit of this approach is that designers can save time and money in creating various designs. (credits: vrs.org.uk)</li>
                <li>In many different fields, the inclusion of virtual reality training opens the doors for a more ‘immersive and engaging’ experience by being able to interact with various components within the VR world (credits: vrs.org.uk). This can be used in an engineering environment to explain and visualise certain concepts and it can also be used in the military to expose soldiers in various conditions to better train them for their missions.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class='arvr4'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Technological Development</h4>
            <p>According to vrs.org.uk, early virtual reality attempts can be dated far back to the nineteenth century with the use of panoramic paintings. However key developments of virtual reality can be seen in: </p>
            <div class='arvrlist5'>
              <ul>
                <li>The link trainer, created by Edward Link in 1929 can be seen as the first example of a flight trainer. The link trainer was designed to be a cost-effective flight trainer to teach pilots how to fly in poor weather conditions where visibility is a minimum and pilots need to rely on the inflight instruments to navigate. The link trainer had pitch, yaw and roll to add the realistic effect, many of these features can be seen in modern flight simulators used by the military and civil aviation.</li>
                <li>Virtual boy by Nintendo can be seen as a rushed failure of a console however it was an opportunity for the general public to be able to experience 3D graphics. Though the price for the system was high and only a few games were to be released on it, the Virtual Boy made VR gaming a first step. </li>
                <li>The Sword of Damocles created by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 is the first augmented reality system that has ‘three-dimensional tracking capabilities’ where it can map out the users' head position. (credit: ‘dsource.in’) </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class='arvr5'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">What is the likely impact? </h4>
            <p>Michael Goeden theorises in his article posted to eLearning Industry that VR technologies will change the education system for practical learning situations. Students will be able to learn more practically more than ever before without any of the risks. for instance, surgeons will be able to perform ultra-detailed mock surgeries to gain experience at a much lower cost and at a much higher quality than through our current mock surgery methods. VR is also seeing implementation in training NASA astronauts to get used to zero-g environments to prepare for space travel. With current space exploration investments from private companies (space X), it is likely we will see more investments into these types of training methods for astronauts.  </p>
            <p>AR will also shape industries in ways other than training, such as in architecture and construction as pointed out by John Biggs in his article he posted to Jobsite. In the future, AR technologies will enable architects to present building plans as 3d AR models to get a more in-depth visualization of what is being designed along with better visualizations of any possible changes to the initial plan. it also helps with delegation and team coordination as workers can see directly what part of the project they will be working on and how their part fits into the bigger picture.   </p>
            <p>VR is shaping the new age of modern office spaces with new programs being developed such as the ‘Metaverse’ from Facebook which they outline their plans for their VR adaptation in the future , they aim to completely remove the need for the office as we know it and replace it all with a virtual workplace, where users can attend things such as meetings from the comfort of their own home but with the “sense of presence” (Facebook metaverse video) of the workplace. The Metaverse aims to maintain the connection of a physical office but allowing all the workers to enjoy the benefits of working from home. If technologies like this become the norm, office spaces will decline in usage, drastically changing the way most businesses operate. The metaverse has also been making strides in shaping the way retail will work in the future. Businesses like Walmart have already made steps into expanding into the virtual reality industry with virtual reality shops where customers can physically see the product on the shelf and even peruse aisles. Expansions like this will revolutionize the retail industry, we may even get to a point where brick and mortar stores are no longer the norm and virtual reality locations take over. However, the repercussions of such a change would be large and affect us in many ways, so such a radical shift might never occur.  </p>
          </div>

          <div class='arvr6'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">How will this affect you? </h4>
            <p>Apart from the possible changes to your workplace, the adoption of VR and AR technologies in the average user’s life could drastically change the way we live, Marcela De Vivo outlines a few possible changes to the average persons life in her article posted to Relaycars, going to a virtual location through VR to order groceries instead of going to a physical location.. AR will bring smart home technologies to the next level, being able to control every aspect of your home through an AR interface, from climate control to home security, all projected onto an AR screen possibly with a small model of your home to accompany it for added convenience, being able to control each aspect with just the touch of a button. Commutes to work can be accompanied with an AR GPS showing you which way to go with a line or arrow directing you in real-time so that you will never get lost again.</p>
            <p>Marcela also goes further and discusses how these technologies could also shape the way users will consume media and entertainment . Instead of watching movies on your computer, you could get a cinema experience in your own home with the power of VR. Video games will be more catered to VR than ever as VR becomes more advanced, with additions such as haptic suits becoming more commercially available the games will become more immersive than ever with you being able to feel the recoil from your gun or the impact of a punch on your body. This will also likely seep into the movie industry, with cinemas possibly having haptic suits and VR headsets allowing you to experience the movie as the main character, meaning that movies can have more personal and immersive stories than ever before. </p>

          <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>

          <div class='cs1'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Overview</h4>
            <p>Technology allows us to store Information in databases and storage mediums. Problems arise when trying to store sensitive information, specifically keeping sensitive data safe and accessible to the right people. Cybersecurity enables the protection of digitized information from threat of digital attack. It is less a singular technology, and more a set of techniques and tech used to protect against digital security threats. CISCO defines this as “the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.” (CISCO 2022)</p>
            <p>The main aim of cybersecurity is to maintain the privacy, validity, and availability of digital data. Privacy pertains to confidentiality, ensuring access to our data is protected against unauthorized third parties. Validity pertains to information integrity, preventing unauthorized use or modification of that data, while availability means ensuring that systems and data are always accessible to the authorised parties.</p>
            <p>Security threats are actions and/or events that threaten the integrity and security of data and information. The threats can be accidental, such as losing a portable storage device containing files, or deliberate, through malware, phishing, and event based such as a power surge. Security threats and the measures against them evolve concurrently. </p>
          </div>

          <div class='cs2'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Rise in Cyber Attacks </h4>
            <p>Digital transformation, and digitization have become a priority for businesses as efficient practice. As much as 40% of companies report having a put into action dedicated Digital Transformation teams. As more of the world and our information systems moves online, cybersecurity becomes increasingly important. Cybersecurity threat over the years have risen. Australia’s annual cyber threat report for 2020 to 2021 reported a 13% increase in cybercrime in one year alone. The skill necessary to become hacker have been decreasingly steadily, and we are witnessing an increase in white-collar cybercrime, and face the potential for organized cybercrime in the near future. Hence, the importance of cybersecurity. White-collar cybercrime is when the hacker is motivated financially to commit a non-directly violent crime. Cybersecurity Analysts are always attempting to figure out how to defend against the unknown and unexpected, needing a blanket approach to be prepared for any threat as defence must be taken because an attack can come from any angle. By comparison, any attacker for a system have a far easier time – requiring only one vulnerability to bypass security. </p>
          </div>

          <div class='cs3'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Threats </h4>
            <p>There are multiple threats out in the world for digital systems. For example, malware, man-in-the-middle-attack etc. These threats put all the information into a great risk of exposure to individuals and businesses’ information. Cybersecurity becomes a necessity as allowing unauthorised access to sensitive data would allow for disastrous results, such as loss of money, customer trust, data and open them up for legal ramifications. </p>
            <p>Malware incorporates a wide range of software to contrary to the users who is infected. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, trojans, spyware and other types of rootkits. </p>
            <p>A computer virus is a program which replicates itself and is often transmitted through removable storage devices. The purpose of the computer virus is that they have a payload that can wreak havoc on a computer. Computer viruses have several methods which they try to avoid detection including:
            <div class='cslist1'>
              <ul>
                <li>Include code within them that encrypts the virus is different</li>
                <li>Rewrite parts of their own code for this purpose </li>
                <li>If it has code that specifically tries to encounter the type of scan that virus checker does</li>
              </ul>
            </div></p>
            <p>A worm is a program that rapidly replicates itself through a network without the need of user assistance and the purpose of a worm is the consumption of bandwidth. Due to the worms, organisations have had to shut down their networks. </p>
            <p>A Trojan virus is a disguised virus which can impact the computer in many ways. This includes:
            <div class='cslist2'>
              <ul>
                <li>Install a spambot</li>
                <li>Install a software that allows the trojan owner to access the computer </li>
                <li>Install pop-up advertisement</li>
                <li>Turn the computer into a zombie </li>
                <li>Delete files in the same way a virus can </li>
              </ul>
            </div>However, Trojan viruses relies on users to download and run the program or distribute than replicating itself.</p>
            <p>Spyware is a type of malware that is concerned with collecting information and is often delivered as the payload via a worm or a trojan. Spyware is does not self-replicate. Adware is a subset of spyware which has function that will frequently display pop-up ads to the user which will affect their browsing habits.  </p>
            <p>Password attacks are threats to the information and are subdivided to two groups: Brute Force attacks and dictionary attacks. Brute force attacks are where every possible password combination is tested. In oppose to brute force attacks, dictionary attacks are where all passwords in a prewritten list are tested.</p>
            <p>A distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack tries to overload web servers and cause them to be unusable instead of stealing or corrupting the data. The loss due to this attack can be very costly. Often achieved with the use of zombies/botnets, an interconnected mass of highjacked computers that can be used to overload web servers. </p>
            <p>Phishing is social deception used to acquire personal information. For example, a fake mock-up of the CommBank website intending to trick people into entering their bank login. There are three types of phishing: Spear phishing, Whaling and Vishing.  </p>
            <div class='cslist3'>
              <ul>
                <li>Spear phishing targets a specific group or type of individual when trying to obtain personal information. Whaling is where a link is sent to a specific individual making them enter critical data about the individual or the organisation they work for. Vishing attack is when a hacker calls a user naming themselves as that they are an employee of a huge company in the desire to gain personal identifiable information.</li>
                <li>Social engineering is key as all the security systems should be used effectively, however if employees do not follow procedures, security can be compromised. The role of social engineering involves: </li>
                <li>Applying advantage of situations to grant access to the system</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Man-In-The-Middle- Attack occurs when someone is monitoring, capturing and controlling the communication occurring between two individuals. This is done using sniffers, programs used to monitor internet traffic and data flow. Unsecured wireless networks (public Wi-Fi in places such as cafes, libraries, malls... etc.) are particularly vulnerable to sniffing. </p>
          </div>

          <div class='cs4'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Cybersecurity Measures</h4>
            <p>Despite the number of threats to the information, there are many practices that can be implemented to ensure the safety to all our data.  </p>
            <p>A firewall filters traffic based on a set of rules that can be changed to suit the environment. An advantage of using the firewall is the fact that it prevents outside intrusion via ports that are not open for any legitimate traffic to or from the organisation. Despite the firewall is good at stopping the spread of worms but it is ineffective to other types of malwares. </p>
            <p>There are two types of firewalls: network firewall and client firewall. The network firewall protects the whole organisation, and the client firewall only protect the computer which is running.
 Antivirus/antispyware software, programs designed to detect malware and spyware. Such software aims to prevent a user from catching malware/spyware from third-party websites, detect malware/spyware that may currently exist in the system, and purge the malware/spyware from the system.</p>
            <p>Encryption is a procedure of encoding information which requires ciphers, algorithms designed to change the message into a disguised message. The original text is referred to a plaintext and the encoded information is known as cipher text. There are two types of encryptions: symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption:
            <div class='cslist4'>
              <ul>
                <li>Symmetrical key encryption is used to send large amount of information across the internet. The encrypted plaintext is referred to as a secret key. The secret key needs to be exchanged to the recipient which will enable him to decrypt the information. A disadvantage is if the secret key is shared to other people, the whole process diminishes, and the information will be unsecure. However, to prevent this is to create multiple secret keys. </li>
                <li>Asymmetric key encryption includes two keys: public key and private key. A public key can only be used encrypt information and not decrypt it. The private key can used to decrypt the information from the encrypted information in the public key. The sender will encrypt the information in public key of the recipient and the recipient can decry the information using the private key. Public key can be sent out to who may wish to send encrypted data to the recipient. But only the recipient has access to the private key. A disadvantage of asymmetric key encryption is that it is not efficient or effective for large amounts of information.</li>
              </ul>
            </div></p>
            <p>Symmetric key encryption is very good at transferring large amounts of data quickly, it has problems with the exchange of the secret key. While the asymmetric key encryption is slow, is one way only and has difficulties with large amount of data. </br>Anonymity tools such as anonymous search engines (DuckDuckGo for example), adblockers, or virtual private networks (VPNs).  </p>
            <p>Anonymous search engines emphasize protecting the searcher’s privacy and avoid filter bubble of search results toward them. Ad blockers are applications that remove or alter the advertisement content on a webpage. Virtual Private Networks extends a private network across a public network which enables users to communicate with the data shared on public networks as if they were on a private network. </p>
            <p>All things that prevent third-party entities from tracking user information or identifying a user. </p>
            <p>Physical security controls are the equipment used to assist in the protection of our data and information. Equipment controls include zone security strategies, barrier techniques and biometric. Physical procedures including backing up our data and information. Physical security measures prevent unauthorised access to hardware and software by using these barriers and authentication techniques. </p>
            <p>Barrier Techniques describes the control of access to an organisation with barriers. The most sensitive information is at the centre of the layers and for someone to have access to it must pass through the surrounding layers. </p>
            <p>Biometrics involve identifying individuals based on unique identifiers of a physical or behavioural nature for example a fingerprint.</p>
            <p>Users can have many access controls and permissions implemented for various things. This enables the only user that should have access to the data should have the way of getting to the information. These can be:
            </br>What you know: Access control dependent on user knowledge (passwords, pins, etc...)
            </br>What you have: Access control dependent on what a user has (keys, credit card, student card, etc...)
            </br>What you are: Access control dependent on what a user is (biometrics, facial scan, etc...) </p>
            <p>‘What you know’ and ‘What you have’ access controls are deterministic, meaning that you are always guaranteed access when you meet the requirements. Though this is less secure as access control objects can be stolen, and access control information can be guessed or stolen. ‘What you are’ access controls are more secure in this regard, but are probalistic, meaning that there is a fail chance with every attempt. Biometric validity and reliablity is still a work in progress. </p>
            <P>Multi--factor authentication is an access control dependent on multiple forms of controls. For example, a combination of credit card, pin, and fingerprint. </p>
            <P>Penetration testing is a sanctioned cyber-attack against a computer system to exploit vulnerabilities that exist within it, solely for testing purposes. It is most effective at exposing potential vulnerabilities when outsourced to third party institutions with no part in creation or implementation of the cybersecurity measures being tested.</p>
            <p>These cybersecurity measures can never guarantee safety. However, implementation error/human error or a lack of general knowledge in utilising cybersecurity measures to their full effect can interfere. Even still, perfectly implemented protective measures may fail. Due to the ever-evolving nature of digital threats, cybersecurity is constantly in a catch up to prevent the next big exploit or data breach. Cybersecurity as an industry is collaborative. A range of open-source cybersecurity resources exist for the purpose of driving collaboration. Cybersecurity conventions are held worldwide.</p>
          </div>

          <div class='cs_5'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Likely Impact</h4>
            <p>There is a lot of impact on different individuals and businesses.  Again, threats and cybersecurity evolve concurrently. Innovation and technology disruption like AI, AR and VR and more are quickly arriving. When new tech arises for any industry, undoubtably new methods of attacking these systems will be invented and necessitates cybersecurity measures be developed and put in place. The top three industries that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks are small business, health care and education.</p>
            <p>Small industries and medium business are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. According to ACSC, both types of business reports of up to $42,341 million in the financial year 2020-21 due to these attacks. These attacks can easily occur due to the fact of not spending enough money for the protection of their data.</p>
            <p>Another industry that is affected by cyber-attacks, in particular ransomware attacks is health care and age care facilities. Healthcare is slow to adopt modern technology and they hold valuable information that can be exploited by attacks. The valuable information is the personal identifiable information of all the patients which makes it a common target for ransomware attacks.  </p>
            <p>Education and Training is also a major field where numerous attacks occur. As the admins of the education are limited to insufficient budgets and resources therefore, they can’t protect student’s data.  In reference to ACSC, 7% of the total ransomware attacks that have been reported is by education and training. </p>
            <p>There is an increase in cyber-attacks and threats towards individuals and different businesses. Due to this increase, there has been a rise in jobs where employees can help organizations and individuals in securing their data and information through cybersecurity measures. </p>
            <p>Cybersecurity is an ever-growing industry as there will always be the risk towards an organization or individual's data, and that risk will only rise and digitization increases. Therefore, jobs in cybersecurity are one of the most desirable careers as cyber-attacks and threats will increase. Especially due to shortages of qualified individuals to fill the gap in protecting one's data and information. Rather than creating job redundancies, cybersecurity will create a multitude of new jobs. </p>
          </div>

          <div class='cs6'>
            <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Affect You</h4>
            <p>Cybersecurity affects us, our friends, family, and others we care about in the same way that it will affect everyone. Individuals that do not have cybersecurity implemented put themselves at huge risk to save themselves comparatively little effort. Consequences range from minor inconveniences like popup viruses, to major crisis events such as identity theft. Many individuals that have faced a cyber-attack would have experienced the risk it has on their data which forced them to be more secure. As cybercrime rates rise and more people begin to implement cybersecurity measures, those that forsake cybersecurity will become easy targets. </p>
            <p>For our group we have not been exposed to cyber threats, but we have learned about what cybersecurity is and why it is necessary to have the measures in our daily lives. Due to being aware of the risk the threats hold on us, we will already implement cybersecurity measures to protect our information from being exposed. Therefore, none of us will have the possibility of a cyber-attack impacting us or we have been already impacted by them.</p>
            <p>Those that have been impacted by cybersecurity would have impacted them a lot financially and mentally. Which enables them to be more secure towards their data and information and will implement cybersecurity measures and stay strict with it</p>
            <p>For those that haven’t been impacted by cybersecurity and are hardly aware of what cybersecurity is will potentially have a high risk of having their data duplicated, used for unauthorized work or even lost. Those that aren’t aware cannot really do anything unless they become aware of cybersecurity through learning about it or being impacted by cyber-attacks.  </p>

          <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

            <div class='AV1'>
              <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Overview</h4>
              <p>With the development and advancement of automation, automated driving is becoming more and more popular. Self-driving vehicles reduce the labor cost of driving, however, can have an impact on employment because of replacing the driver's presence or reducing the requirements for drivers. An autonomous vehicle, as known as a self-driving car, which is a vehicle that can sense its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. (Wikipedia, 2022) “An autonomous vehicle uses variety kinds of sensors to recognize the environment around it, such as camera, GPS, sonar, lidar, thermographic camera and inertial measurement units.”</p>
            </div>

            <div class='AV2'>
              <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">History and Current Use</h4>
                <p>The first autonomous vehicle model was created at the 1939 World’s Fair by General Motors and turned into reality in 1958. it was an electric vehicle guided by radio-controlled electromagnetic fields and operated from magnetized metal spikes embedded in the roadway and can control the steering wheel to left or right depending on the current flowing detected using sensor through a wire embedded in the road. (tomorrowsworldtoday, n.d.) </p>
                <p>According to the definition of 6 levels of driving automation by The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), self-driving vehicles are ranged from level 0 (entirely manually) to level 5 (entirely autonomous). (synopsys, 2022)</p>

                      <td>Level 0</td>
                      <td>No driving automation, fully controlled by human driver</td>

                <p>For level 0 to level 2, vehicles are being driven with human drivers monitoring the environment, where level 3 to level 5, vehicles are driving with the environment monitored by the automated driving system. </p>
            </div>

            <div class='AV3'>
              <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Future of Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
              <p>Companies are working on level 3 conditional automation, which allows drivers have their eyes off the road but not mind off, which means they need to be ready to take back control from self-driving systems when alerted. However, self-driving systems are only able to reach level 2 partial automation in the 6 levels defined by SAE, where human drivers must monitor the driving environment on the road and respond to all situations (cars, 2022). “It’s our objective to roll out this technology this year,” says Kallenius, the CEO of Mercedes-Benz on the Mercedes’ 2021 results call. (Sigal, 2022) As the leader in the study of automated vehicles, Mercedes-Benz is working towards level 3 conditional automated vehicles and aiming to have them in production and put in use in 2022. </p>
              <p>There are number of challenges and difficulties in the development path of automated driving vehicles, the biggest challenge being the ethical aspect. Machines do not have the ability to consider moral issues like humans do, so it is very important for them to be able to make the most reasonable judgment and behaviour in times of crisis. “Driving requires many complex social interactions – which are still tough for robots” (Plumer, 2012). Self-driving on road involves interactions not only the driver and passengers in the self-driving vehicles, also other drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, therefore making the self-driving vehicles able to understand complex driving environment and make the most ethical or appropriate judgments are the main challenges. </p>
            </div>

            <div class='AV4'>
              <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Social and Economic Impacts of Autonomous Vehicles </h4>
              <p>There are several ways that self-driving will have impacts on society. They will dramatically improve the convenience and reduce the cost of traveling for people. Some people predict that as the road system is overhauled and become more efficient, the travel time will decrease immediately, bring a smoother traffic flow with less congestion at intersections and mergers. But on the other side, some people predict that as the increase of different cars being allowed on the road, the increase of congestions will appear (Yeruva, 2022). Self-driving cars can also increase the accessibility of mobility for people who are not able to drive such as, seniors, people with disabilities or even children, allow them to have better access to independent commuting. Use of self-driving cars is likely to decrease the effect of carbon emissions from vehicles on our environment. Self-driving cars will be harder to operate with fossil fuels, therefore they incentivise the switch to electric power as a power source (Darlington, 2018). “Along with that, self-driving cars might also cause economic impacts on the fossil fuel market.” </p>
              <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">Impacts on Job Markets </h4>
              <p>Self-driving cars also have a great impact on the job market, leading a significant job loss. Report by The Center for Global Policy Solution published in 2017 shows that 4 million jobs can be lost due to the rapid transition to self-driving cars (Solutions, 2012). But on the other hand, jobs within the autonomous vehicle industry, such as, remote human operators, tele-operators or remote assistance, which will handle a situation when the self-driving car could not figure out how to respond (Coppola, 2021), will create more job positions, because the current technology only reach a level 2 automation which is not enough to make self-driving car to replace all the car with human driver on the road. </p>
              <h4 style="color:#ebffe8;">How will it affect you? </h4>
              <p>The exist of self-driving cars affect everyone, people who can drive, and people who are not able to drive like children, people with disabilities or elders. Once self-driving technology become stable enough to allow vehicles travel safely without human monitoring, people who cannot drive are become able to travel around with vehicles without the need of a driver. This also save time and energy for those who need to drive just pick up or drop off their family members or friends who cannot drive. Instead of needing a family member or friend to drive you or catching public transport and spend time on waiting the next bus or train, traveling with a self-driving car will be much convenient and more comfortable. </p>
              <p>According to a family member who specialises for a public transport maintenance company, said that the advent of self-driving cars might reduce the number of accident cause by human on the road, and the maintenance workload could be deceased as a result. The decrease in maintenance workload means that the company may no longer need that many employees, and he feels that he may end up losing his job. However, he still thinks that self-driving cars will brings positive effects on his family. He then no longer needs to pick up or drop off his children from or to their weekend activities and able to enjoy his break. The other member from my family who need to spend nearly two hours on driving between home and workplace said that if she owns a self-driving car, she could save plenty of time on driving, and while the vehicle driving her to workplace, she could rest longer or getting prepare for work, and she does not need to spend more energy on driving after a whole day working. </p>
