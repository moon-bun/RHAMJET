      For us at RHAMJET, our main risks all stem from one core issue; lack of technical know-how in the required areas to facilitate the timely development of our application. In order for us to even begin development of our first deliverable, our team needs to be proficient in java as all our deliverables are being developed as android applications which all but require java. Thanks to this we have quite a sizeable list of risks:  <br><br>

      Firstly, the software could be too challenging to learn by yourself within the timeframe of the assignment, leaving us with either no artifacts or simpler artifacts which may not represent our initial vision due to having to use workarounds. This is by far the biggest risk for us here at RHAMJET as we acknowledge how challenging it is to learn a new programming language especially within the short, 3-week timeframe. <br><br>

      Secondly, since we are making the individual pieces of the application separately it may be challenging or even impossible to put these pieces together with our current skillset, ie we are making the QR code reader separately from our AR presenter so it may be challenging to get them to work together on one application. This is a very plausible risk, especially considering how we are all relatively new to the Java coding language. The QR code scanner and AR functionalities are both using off the shelf code which are depending on external GitHub repositories made by other people. This can be a risk as changes to the repository may change the behaviour of our app or even break all functionalities. <br><br>

      Thirdly, even if we do manage to learn the software within the timeframe it may not even be able to accommodate our needs for the project deeming all the time spent learning it wasted, although this risk is a minor one at best as it is a given that the members would do adequate research beforehand to ensure that the software is capable of completing the required task before devoting time to learning it <br><br>

      Finally, the most obvious risk for a task as ambitious as the one we are undertaking is simply that we cannot complete it or make substantial progress within the allocated time period, this is a very real risk for us as learning an entire programming language to produce something as advanced as an AR presenter in as short as 3 weeks will definitely test us. </p>
