    </div>
    <div class="sum">
    RHAMJET's objective with RhamScan is to create an accessible, educational
    art-game application. This will be a product targeting Melbourne artists
    as well as the general casual mobile gamer market in Melbourne. RhamScan
    as a platform aims to encourage Melbourne citizens to engage with and learn
    about Melbourne art, art culture, and art as a hobby. We will achieve this
    by superimposing an open-source gallery onto reality, made viewable through
    a phone camera and QR codes. Users will be invited to contribute to the
    gallery with their own art and incentivized to hunt for other people's art
    through a point system and gamified geocaching mechanics. Our primary aim
    is to complete at least one of our deliverable goals to demonstrate a
    functional element of RhamScan. Each deliverable chosen showcases a key
    aspect of our app. In tandem, all three work together to achieve our aim.
  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ar">
    <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) APPLICATION</h1>
    Our priority is an AR Application. Through the app, a user will be able to project art onto their environment through the view of their mobile phones. 'Art' in this instance only refers to 2D art that a user can represent digitally, i.e., photos of traditional drawings, paintings, digital illustrations... etc.  We will begin with Android app development, pushing back iOS app development for future consideration. At minimum, completion of this goal should involve displaying a work of art that is only viewable through an AR environment inside a mobile phone. This goal is integral to RhamScan as an application, acting as the novel innovative element that draws in consumers. It is a key part of our game mechanics. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="qr">
        <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">QR CODE AND SCANNER</h1>
    <p>
      Second priority. RhamScan needs to be able to generate QR codes for submitted art. When a RhamScan generated QR code is scanned, it must return the artwork as viewable through our AR environment, as well as information about the art piece itself. At minimum, completion of this goal should include a QR code that when scanned returns either an art piece, or information about the art piece. The QR Code and scanner mechanics fulfil our aim of sharing art and disseminating art knowledge. Furthermore, it is integral to the geocaching aspect of Rhamscan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ui">
    <h1 style= "font-size: 35px">UI(USER INTERFACE) PROTOTYPE</h1>
    <p>Low priority goal compared to the above. UI for both the mobile app and art hosting website must be designed and prototyped, though the mobile app UI is priority. RhamScan is a mobile app first and foremost, designed as a mobile game that a user plays while actively travelling the city. At minimum, RhamScan should begin research into our user groups and competitor apps. Prototyping, game design, and user testing may begin after. It is important to design with our consumers in mind from the beginning because even if RhamScan is a functional app, if it is not a useable or pleasant experience everything will be for naught. </p>
