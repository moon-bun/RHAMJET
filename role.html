     Upon receiving the assignment 3 brief and evaluating our assignment
     specifications, it was decided that team RHAMJET would be split into
      two groups: a Research team and a Technologies (Tech) team. Research
       would be responsible for the bulk of report writing, everything
        regarding RhamScan as a project and RHAMJET's processes as a team.
         The Tech team would be responsible for our artifacts, and the sections
          of our report related to the artifacts. All assignment 3 tasks were
           evaluated according to these criteria and designated to each team.
           <p>

RHAMJET decided on two leadership positions. Research Lead, and a Lead
Developer with an Assistant Developer. Our Research Lead, Elliot, manages the
 Research Team. He oversees all Research tasks to maintain coherence between
 sections. RhamScan as a project was developed from the seed of Elliot's
 assignment 1 project idea, thus Elliot is the most qualified team member
 to proofread work written about the project. Research team members include
 Hunter, Moon, and Roma.
 <p>

Our Lead Developer, Abel, manages our Tech Team in the same way. Abel is the
 best option for Lead Developer as the most technically knowledgeable member
  of RHAMJET. Tech team members include Jamie, Roma, and Tyler.
  <p>

Jamie is our Assistant Developer and a secondary leader within the Tech Team.
 A second lead is necessary due to the scope of the Tech Teams responsibilities
  (mainly due to the multiple tech artefacts). Jamieâ€™s skillset is flexible
   enough to make him a good fit for this position when paired with Abel.
   <p>

Team positions are loosely defined and flexible. All members are able to
 outsource help from other members, but our roles provide general direction
 and shorthand for determining skillsets. As work is completed, team members
  are assigned further tasks.
  <p>

Nearing the end of the assignment, a Design Team was put together for the
 creation of our website. This consisted of Roma, Moon, and Abel. These people
  were best suited for the position considering availability and skillsets.</p>
