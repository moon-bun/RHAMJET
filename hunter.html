          <h2>IT background</h2>
          <p>I am interested in Game development and Interactive media. My interest in IT came from my first exposure to IT when I had my first programming class in middle school. It was fun to make small games by myself using Visual Basic that I learned in class. I have learned some VB and Microsoft Access in high school and have learned basic python programming, 3D modeling and rendering in my previse year in university.

            <h2>Interest</h2>
            <p>I like to play games in my free time, usually on mobile phone. It is fun to communicate and interact with people from other places of the world in games. I speak both Mandarin and Cantonese at home. I like to learn foreign language, I started learning Japanese since high school for 5 years, learned some basic Korean in the past year, looking forward to learn a new western language, maybe Spanish.

            <h2>INFP-T/Tactile Learner/Hunmanitarian career personality</h2>
            <p>Hunter is introverted and predicted to work well alone. Dubbed a 'mediator' type, with an intuitive talent that lends itself well to maintainning group harmony. A 'humanitarian' personality indicates that Hunter may becoma an insightful idea generator for our team. Like Roma, Hunter is also a practical learner and would do best assigned to practical tasks.</p>
